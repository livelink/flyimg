The Flyimg project is a Dockerized application that allows you to resize, crop, and compress images on the fly.  One Docker container to build your own Cloudinary-like service.

By default, Flyimg generates the **AVIF** image format (when the browser supports it)  which provides superior compression compared to other formats.

Additionally, Flyimg also generates the **WebP** format, along with the impressive **MozJPEG** compression algorithm to optimize images, other formats are supported also such as **PNG** and **GIF**.

## Fetch an image from anywhere; resize, compress, cache and serve...<small> and serve, and serve, and serve...</small>

You pass the image URL and a set of keys with options, like size or compression. Flyimg will fetch the image, convert it, store it, cache it and serve it. The next time the request comes, it will serve the cached version.

## Demo
Check out our demo page where you can test and review Flying's features:

[https://demo.flyimg.io/](https://demo.flyimg.io)

## Cloud Run Button

Flyimg can be deployed to GCP as a serverless container in one click with Cloud Run Button:

## Requirements

You will need to have **Docker** on your machine. Optionally you can use Docker machine to create a virtual environment. We have tested on **Mac**, **Windows** and **Ubuntu**.

## Installation [Deployment mode]

Pull the docker image

```bash
docker pull flyimg/flyimg-build
```

Start the container

```bash
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 flyimg/flyimg-build
```

To use custom parameters, make a copy of [parameters.yml](https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg/blob/main/config/parameters.yml) to your current directory. Update to suit your needs and run the command with volume parameter to replace the original parameters file.

```bash
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd)/parameters.yml:/var/www/html/config/parameters.yml flyimg/flyimg-build
```

Check [how to provision the application](#how-to-provision-the-application-on)

## Installation [Development Mode]

You can spin up your own working server in 10 minutes using the provision scripts for [AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://github.com/flyimg/Elastic-Beanstalk-provision) or the [DigitalOcean Ubuntu Droplets](https://github.com/flyimg/DigitalOcean-provision) <small>(more environments to come)</small>. For other environments or if you want to tweak and play in your machine before rolling out, read along...

### Installation

You can use `git` or `composer` for the first step.

#### with git

```sh
git clone https://github.com/flyimg/flyimg.git
```

#### with composer

Create the project with `composer create` .

```sh
composer create-project flyimg/flyimg
```

**CD into the folder** and to build the docker image by running:

```sh
docker build -t flyimg .
```

This will download and build the main image, It will take a few minutes. If you get some sort of error related to files not found by apt-get or similar, try this same command again.

**IMPORTANT!** If you cloned the project, only for the first time, you need to run `composer install` **inside** the container:

```sh
docker exec -it flyimg composer install
```

Again, it will take a few minutes to download the dependencies. Same as before, if you get some errors you should try running `composer install` again.

Then run the container:

```sh
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/var/www/html --name flyimg flyimg
```

For Fish shell users:

```sh
docker run -itd -p 8080:80 -v $PWD:/var/www/html --name flyimg flyimg
```

The above command will make the Dockerfile run supervisord command which launches 2 processes: **nginx** and **php-fpm** and starts listening on port 8080.

## Testing Flyimg service

You can navigate to your machine's IP in port 8080 (ex: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` ) ; you should get a message saying: **Hello from Flyimg!** and a small homepage of Flyimg already working. If you get any errors at this stage it's most likely that composer has not finished installing or skipped something.

You can test your image resizing service by navigating to: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/upload/w_130,h_113,q_90/https://mudawn.com/assets/butterfly-3000.jpg`

**It's working!**

This is fetching an image from Mozilla, resizing it, saving it and serving it.

### Full Documentation

Full documentation available here **[docs/full-documentation.md](docs/full-documentation.md)**

## How to transform images

You go to your server URL`http://imgs.kitty.com` and append `/upload/`; after that you can pass these options below, followed by an underscore and a value `w_250,q_50` Options are separated by coma (configurable to other separator).

After the options put the source of your image, it can be relative to your server or absolute: `/https://my.storage.io/imgs/pretty-kitten.jpg`

So to get a pretty kitten at 250 pixels wide, with 50% compression, you would write.
`<img src="http://imgs.kitty.com/upload/w_250,q_50/https://my.storage.io/imgs/pretty-kitten.jpg">`
